# Swift React Native example

This project loads react native as a view into an existing Swift iOS app. It defines a custom view in Swift that accepts a property and configures a custom view. In this case a simple label.

The goal of this repo is to demonstrate how you could integrate React Native into an already existing Swift app and to bridge your existing Swift components to React Native.

To setup the app, do the following after checking out the project.


    npm install -g react-native-cli
    npm install
    pod install
    npm start

Then open the `IntegrateRN.xcworkspace` and run the app.
